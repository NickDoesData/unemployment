    "\n",
    "<b>Civilian Population:</b> Civilian noninstitutional population is defined as persons 16 years of age and older residing in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, who are not inmates of institutions (e.g., penal and mental facilities, homes for the aged), and who are not on active duty in the Armed Forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Employed Workers:</b> Individuals who did any work for pay or profit. Includes full-time and part-time employees, individuals who did at least 15 hours of unpaid work in a family-operated enterprise; and individuals who were temporarily absent from their regular jobs because of illness, vacation, bad weather, industrial dispute, or various personal reasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Unemployed Workers:</b> Individuals who do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks, and are currently available for work. Persons who were not working and were waiting to be recalled to a job from which they had been temporarily laid off are also included as unemployed. Receiving benefits from the Unemployment Insurance (UI) program has no bearing on whether a person is classified as unemployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Civilian Labor Force:</b> Individuals classified as employed or unemployed. Includes full-time students, retirees, and employment age individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Marginally Attached Workers:</b> Individuals not in the labor force who want and are available for work, and who have looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months, but were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. Marginally attached workers are not classified as either employed or unemployed - they are not participating in the labor force.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Discouraged Workers:</b> A subsuet of marginally attached workers, discouraged workers are not currently looking for work specifically because they believed no jobs were available for them or there were none for which they would qualify. Discouraged workers are not classified as either employed or unemployed - they are not participating in the labor force."
